# Model-Data-using-Cassandra

## Overview

This repository contains the Jupyter Notebook for modeling data using Apache Cassandra. The project focuses on creating a NoSQL database for a music streaming app to analyze user activity and song data.

## Project Description

### Objective

The objective of this project is to create a NoSQL database using Apache Cassandra to help a music streaming app, SoundCloud, analyze user activity and song data more efficiently. The key tasks include:

1. **Introduction**: Understanding the challenges faced by SoundCloud in querying CSV-stored data and the benefits of using a NoSQL database.
2. **Data Modeling**: Designing and creating a Cassandra database to store and query the data effectively.
3. **Querying**: Implementing queries to solve specific business problems related to user activity and song data analysis.

## File Description

- **Model Data using Cassandra.ipynb**: This is the main Jupyter Notebook file containing all the code, explanations, and output for the project tasks.

## Requirements

To run the notebook, you will need the following Python packages:
- `pandas`
- `cassandra-driver`
- `jupyter`

The project involved creating a NoSQL database using Apache Cassandra to store and analyze music streaming data from SoundCloud. The CSV data was modeled and inserted into Cassandra tables, enabling efficient querying and analysis. Specific queries were implemented to solve business problems related to user activity and song preferences, demonstrating the effectiveness of the NoSQL approach for this use case.
